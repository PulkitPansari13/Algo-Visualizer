# Algo Visualizer ðŸ”®

This project was developed to help people learn and view the inner working of various sorting algorithms. You can access it here. [algovizz.netlify.app](https://algovizz.netlify.app/).

## Features.

1. Control the size of randomly generated array.
2. Control the visualization speed.
3. Reset to original unsorted array.
4. Compare the no. of swaps and comparison made by each sorting algorithm.

## Algorithms Visualized

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Random Quick Sort
